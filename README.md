Sony Bravia remote control via home network

This web page and cgi code allows controlling of Sony Bravia televisions in home network. You need preferably Linux based host with
lighttpd to serve the page and cgi. The cgi code needs libcgic-dev to compile. You can modify the SONY_URL in sony.html to set the IP
address of the television. Also the 'simple control' needs to be enabled from television settings.

Control protocol is described here:
